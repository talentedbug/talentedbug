👋 Hello there!

Me the Bug am Talented Bug.

Let's start with a simple self-introduction. Tags:

- 🐸 My online alias is always Talented Bug, hailing from Yangzhou, Jiangsu. Currently studying at Yangzhou Middle School of Jiangsu Province, aka "YZZX."
- 🏃‍♂️ AFO'd OIer, entered CSP-J in 2022, retired from NOIP in 2024.
- 📢 Native Chinese speaker, second language English, with a smattering of French.
- ⌨️ In another sense of the word "language," familiar with Python and C, currently learning Rust. Ferris 🦀 is just adorable.
- 🔧 Life never stops, and neither does my tinkering.
    - 2.5-year user of Arch Linux, with a bit of RHEL maintenance experience.
    - Light embedded player, my biggest achievement is the clock on my desk.
    - Obsessed with self-hosting, there's an Orange Pi hidden in a corner of YZZX 🤫.
- 🌳 Tulin Bug, adhering to the principles of "humor, inclusivity, and creativity."
- 📚 Hopeless in humanities, yet still passionate about literature and firmly believe that "serious superficiality is inferior to profound humor."
- 🎮 A bad yet enthusiastic gamer, loves Minecraft but can't survive a day without creative mode 😂.
- ⭕ Heard MBTI is all the rage. Though I doubt its validity, my result is INTP-A Logician.

Can't think of more for now, I'll write again when I remember something.
