👋 Hello there!

Me the Bug, also known as **Talented Bug**.

## Talented Bug

Let’s kick things off with a brief introduction.

### Tags

- 🐸 Online, I go by Talented Bug, hailing from Yangzhou, Jiangsu. Currently studying at Yangzhou High School of Jiangsu Province, aka YZZX.
- 🏃‍♂️ Retired OIer (competitive programmer): entered CSP-J in 2022 and retired after NOIP 2024.
- 📢 Native Chinese speaker, fluent in English, and dabbling in French.
- ⌨️ Another kind of language: proficient in Python and C, currently learning Rust. Ferris the Crab 🦀 is adorable, but the syntax? Not so much.
- 🔧 Tinkering is life:
  - Arch Linux user for 2.5 years, with a sprinkle of RHEL sysadmin experience.
  - Light embedded systems enthusiast—my biggest project so far ia a desk clock.
  - Obsessed with self-hosting. (Once had an Orange Pi stashed in a corner of Yangzhou High. Gone now 🤫.)
- 🌳 [Tulin Bug](https://tulin.netlify.app), adhering to the “Humor, Inclusivity, Creativity” principles of Tulin.
- 📚 Terrible at humanities but love literature. Firm believer in “profound humor beats serious superficiality.”
- 🎮 A noob who loves gaming. Big fan of Minecraft, but let’s be real—survival is impossible without Creative Mode 😂.
- ⭕ Heard MBTI is all the rage. Though I doubt its accuracy, I’m apparently an INTP-A (Logician).

That’s all I can think of for now. I’ll add more when inspiration strikes.
